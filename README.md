# Scooter Rental

The Scooter Rental program is designed to manage the rental of electric scooters to customers. It allows customers to rent a scooter, ride it around the city, and then return it to the rental station when they are finished. The program handles all aspects of the rental process, from checking the availability of scooters to calculating rental fees.

One of the key features of the Scooter Rental program is its use of TDD methodology. This approach involves writing tests for each feature of the program before writing the code to implement it. This ensures that each feature is thoroughly tested and that any bugs or errors are caught early in the development process. TDD also makes the program more maintainable by providing a comprehensive set of tests that can be run whenever changes are made to the code.

In addition to TDD, the Scooter Rental program uses a variety of programming concepts and design patterns to ensure that it is well-structured and easy to understand. These include object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, as well as design patterns such as the Factory Method and Observer patterns.
